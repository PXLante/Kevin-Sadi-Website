									Thank you for taking the time to look through the site! I didn't feel as though I was able to really explain my background,
									so I thought I would be able to through my website.

							<p><img src="images/Dad.jpg" alt="Afghanistan" style="float:right;width:400px;height:200px"> My family is originally from Afghanistan and Iran. As I briefly mentioned, I am a Baha'i.
						  The Baha'i faith believes in unity between aspects of life. However, in Iran, the Baha'i religion is not tolerated. Because of this, both my mother and father had to escape from Iran. My mom's family moved to italy,
							however my dad struggled to escape. He had no money, because his family did not have any money. He first went to Afghanistan to meet his parents, or my grandparents. However, in Afghanistan he was run over by a truck.
							He needed medical attention, but could not reclieve any in Afghanistan, so he ran to Italy for medical attention. He met my mother here, but still could not be treated in Italy, so he eventually managed to come to America.
						  It was there that he worked several jobs and to bought real estate. He worked hard and eventually moved between Italy and America until I was born. </p>

							</br>

							<p><img src="images/italy.jpg" alt="italy" style="float:right;width:400px;height:200px"> I was born in Atlanta, Georgia. However, I moved to Italy with my family soon after for 4 years.
							My family decided that America would be better for me to get an education. Now any of my family that stayed in Iran is now dead, where my family on my mother's side is in Italy.
						  I am incredibly greatful to be in America today, for the opportunity it has given me to obtain an education and celebrate my culture. </p>
