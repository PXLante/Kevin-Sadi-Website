								<p>
									Thank you for taking the time to look through the site! I didn't feel as though I was able to really explain my background,
									so I thought I would be able to through my website.

							<p><img src="images/Dad.jpg" alt="Afghanistan" style="float:right;width:400px;height:200px"> My family is originally from Afghanistan and Iran. As I briefly mentioned, I am a Baha'i.
						  The Baha'i faith believes in unity of mankind. However, in Iran, the Baha'i religion is not tolerated. Because of this, both my mother and father had to escape from Iran. My mom's family moved to Italy,
							however my dad struggled to escape. He had absolutly nothing in Iran. He had no money, and he was recently injured; he was run over by a truck. He first went to Afghanistan to visit his relatives, but he could not be
							treated in Afghanistan, so he went to Pakistan. He was treated a little in Pakistan, and was sent to America for surgery. In America he worked several jobs to get enough money to go to Italy.
								In Italy, he eventually met and married my mother, and then they moved to America where I was born. </p>

							<p><img src="images/italy.jpg" alt="italy" style="float:right;width:400px;height:200px"> I was born in Atlanta, Georgia. However, I moved to Italy with my family soon after for a year.
							My family decided that America would be better for me to get an education. Now I have no family in Iran, where my family on my mother's side is in Italy.
						  I am incredibly grateful to be in America today, for the opportunity it has given me to obtain an education and celebrate my culture. </p>
