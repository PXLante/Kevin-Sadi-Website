								</header>
								<p>
									Thanks for taking the time to look through the site! There was a lot about my interesting background that I felt didn't fit into my application,
									 so I thought this would be a perfect opportunity to share about my past.

							<p><img src="images/Dad.jpg" alt="Afghanistan" style="float:right;width:400px;height:200px"> My family is originally from Afghanistan and Iran. However, in both countries there is religious persecution towards my religion,
							Baha'i. Because of this, both my mom and dad had to escape from Iran. My mom escaped straight to Italy, however my dad struggled to escape. He went to Afghanistan to Pakistan and then managed to move to Italy.
						  It was there that he worked several jobs, and moved to America to buy real estate. He worked hard and eventually moved between Italy and America until I was born.  </p>

							<p><img src="images/italy.jpg" alt="italy" style="float:right;width:400px;height:200px"> I was born in Atlanta, Georgia. However, I moved to Italy with my family soon after for 4 years. My family decided that
							America would be better for me to get an education. A lot of family lives in Italy now because of the religious persecution in Iran, and they sometimes come to America to visit. </p>
